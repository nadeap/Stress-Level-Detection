# Stress-Level-Detection

This project was created to detect a person's stress level. To detect the stress level, it is necessary to input several variables such as: 
1. Humidity Value
2. Body Temperature
3. Number of Steps

After inputting these variables, you can get the results of predicting stress levels consisting of 3 classes:
- Low
- Medium
- High

To run this project on a local host, you must install some requirements (requirements.txt).
